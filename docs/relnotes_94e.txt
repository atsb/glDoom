Release Notes - glDoom version 0.94e

Since glDoom uses InstallShield to install itself, it also creates
a menu option on the start menu to run it as well as a link to the
glDoom.doc file.  It also puts a menu option up to remove the program
from your system.  (as well as in the "Add/Remove Programs" applet in
the Control Panel)  If you move glDoom after installation, you break
the links for the these menu options and the uninstall program.

Don't move it unless you know how to correct these things manually.
If you want to move it, then UNINSTALL it and reinstall it where you
want it.

The preferred method of running glDoom is from the Start menu but
you can run it from a DOS or "command" prompt, too.

Maintenance release

Bugs fixed in this released are:

1. glDoom.ini file path is determined using the program path name used
   to run the program and the current directory.

2. The mvert default was changed to "on" so that the vertical mouse axis
   works as the default unless it is toggled with the mvert key.

3. It is now possible to run glDoom from a full-screen (text) dos or
   "command" prompt as well as from short cuts and the Start menu.

4. Fixed the horizontal texture scrolling. (turned it back on)

5. Switch texture alignments have been fixed so that they look right, now.

6. Fixed the context switching problem for the mouse and keyboard.

7. The music is now paused when you switch away from the program and
   the game paused properly as well.  Before I just interrupted the
   game loop. Now it sends a pause key press to the game engine when
   you switch to it and away from it.

Notes:

I.   I am still working on the internal commands. That will take some
     time to complete.

II.  I am working on a problem with Diamond's MX-300 sound card. It
     apparently cannot do DirectSound acceleration and Midi music at
     the same time.  I'm not sure what the resolution of this will be.

III. If you are using a 3Dfx card and you get a white "box" in the
     spider demon frames, then you need to toggle the value of gl_widetex
	 in your gldoom.ini file.  The 3Dfx card can't display textures
	 wider than 256 and the spider demon has a frame that is 257 wide
	 so it goes "white" on that frame.  Changing gl_widetex will truncate
	 this frame (you won't notice it) the next time you start glDoom.

IV.  The mouse and keyboard context switching problem was due to an
     inconsistency in Microsoft's DirectInput.  The code I was checking
	 for to see if the mouse or keyboard had been lost for input checked
	 for the result "DIERR_INPUTLOST".  This is what DirectX 5 returns
	 when the input device is lost.  But DirectX 3 was returning
	 "DIERR_NOTACQUIRED" as if the device had never been acquired at all
	 and it clearly had been. At least I figured out what the problem
	 was. And now I check both of them.
