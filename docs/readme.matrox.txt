glDoom Alpha Readme

This binary of glDoom is for Matrox evaluation and driver work only.
It requires the file sky1top.bmp (included) because this is the build
that was done for the sky artist to work with.  Some features have
been disabled to make the program more stable.

It does not have the lightmaps enabled but most other functionality
required from OpenGL is being used.  The fog code to emulate the light
attenuation over distance has not been implemented in this build.

It will work fine with the shareware Doom, registered Doom or Ultimate
Doom IWAD files on episode 1 only.  Some of the levels do not function
properly because of geometry errors in those levels. A later build will
have this problem sorted out.  The IWAD must from version 1.9 for this
to function, though.

If you have the sky1top.bmp and doom.wad in directory with the program,
it should function normally unless a card specific driver is required
in the game directory.

This program is not under ANY circumstances to be released, copied for,
transmitted or given to anyone other than Matrox personnel and then
only for the express purpose of Matrox OpenGL driver verification.
The program may not be uploaded to any public forum or location designed
for public access.

It is agreed further that any and all copies of this program will be
destroyed by Matrox once OpenGL driver testing is complete.

If you have any questions about this program, please contact Bruce Lewis
via e-mail at brucel@abraxis.com.  I will respond as quickly as possible.
